1. WAP to print " HELLO World" using C++.
->
   #include<iostream>
   Using namespace std;
   
   int main()
   {
       count<< "HELLOW WORLD";
    }


2.What is OOP ? List OOP concepts.

->   OOP stand for "object-oriented Programming.

->   c++ is OOP Language.

->   Procedural programming is about writing procedures or function that perform operation on the data,
     while object-oriented programming is about creating object that contain both data and function.

=> concept of oop
   1.Classes / Object
   2.Encapsulation
   3.inheritance
   4.polymorphism
   5.Abstraction
   6.Data Binding or Dynamic
   

3. What is difference bettween OOP  and  POP?

->               OOP                                                         POP

     1.Object-Oriented Programming                            1.Procedural oriented programming.
      
     2.It deals with data                                     2.Its deals with algorithms.

     3.programs are divided into object.                      3.programs are divided into Function.

     4.Data Structure characterzes object.                    4.Most of the function share global data

     5.Function that operate on data are                      5.Data move from function to function.
       blind to form classes.

     6.Data hidden cannot be accessed by                      6.Function are Responsible for transformating 
       outside function.                                         from one from to another.

     7.It is Bottom Up approach.                              7.It is top down approach.

     8.It needs more memory that pop.                         8.Its needs more memory that pop

     9.                                                       9.
       EX:-  C++,java,.Net                                      EX:- C, Fortran

     10.It is more Secure.                                    10.It is less secure.

     11.It has access specifiers like                         11. It follows no overloading.
        Private,public and Protected.
